Hi, I'm Moiz!

I'm a Mechanical Engineering Graduate from Imperial College London with an interest in applied mathematics, solid mechanics, and coffee :)

I've spent a lot of my course coding to process and visualise data, but I'm looking to take this interest past my graduation for some fun.

Watch this space!
